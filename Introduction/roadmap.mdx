# Loyal Roadmap

We are building a network that pairs trusted compute with actionable intelligence. Each phase compounds on the last so that by the time we open the marketplace, providers, developers, and end users already trust the rails. Here is the path we are driving.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (Q4 2025)
**Objective:** Stand up the core infrastructure and first user touchpoints.
- Bring up our testnet compute (we host it).
- Ship the first client app (chat).
- Set up wallet-based payments with spending limits.

## Phase 1 — Trust & Security (Q1 2025)
**Objective:** Prove the network is secure and verifiable from day one.
- Add hardware-based attestation checks for all compute nodes.
- Publish an audit page (images, policies, latest quotes) and a simple local verifier tool.

## Phase 2 — AI Oracles Marketplace (MVP)
**Objective:** Deliver the minimal marketplace flow with integrity built in.
- On-chain registry of “inference oracles.”
- Request → pay → result, with proof from a confidential VM.
- Multisig billing; simple pricing.

## Phase 3 — Developer Platform
**Objective:** Make it effortless for builders to ship on Loyal without exposing user data.
- Sandbox for third-party tools that never see user data.
- One-command publish tool + minimal SDK.
- Run a hackathon to onboard early builders.

## Phase 4 — Agent Graph & Orchestrator
**Objective:** Orchestrate complex workflows across agents with transparency.
- Registry of tools/agents with interfaces and cost.
- Workflow planning and basic reputation/ratings.
- Open API for on-chain agents.

## Phase 5 — Off-Chain Data Framework
**Objective:** Turn unstructured communications into structured memory.
- Ingest email / Telegram / X → normalize → extract facts → write to memory graph.
- Track metrics: fact coverage, P95 latency, false-positive rate.

## Phase 6 — Client Apps Expansion
**Objective:** Meet users where they are with responsive, trustworthy experiences.
- iOS/Android: light on-device model for fast triage; heavy tasks in confidential compute (streaming UX).
- Farcaster/Telegram mini-app with wallet-signed actions + spending limits.
- SMS/Voice entry; audio processed end-to-end inside confidential compute.

## Phase 7 — Pre-ICO Readiness
**Objective:** Lock in the economic, legal, and security foundations for launch.
- Token utility, economics, and governance outline.
- Legal/compliance review.
- Security audits and bug bounty.
- Litepaper, docs, community programs, provider grants.

## Phase 8 — Launch & Scale
**Objective:** Open the network, prove reliability, and grow the ecosystem.
- Open the marketplace to external providers.
- SLOs for latency/uptime; cost transparency.
- Partnerships and ecosystem fund.
