<Card title="Who we are and why we care">
  We've been working together for the last 3 years on things we care a lot about.
  We've built and scaled data-driven applications that handled terabytes of data every day.

  We've seen the evil of surveillance capitalism and the power of centralized data collection and monetization.

  If we continue down this path, we'll be heading for a grave future.

  We want to fight for privacy and freedom. 

  That's why we're building Loyal.

  _**PS**: We're also great friends._
  _Eden and Chris have been best friends for the last 6 years._
  _Basil and Vasiliy have known each other since primary school. They've been friends for over 20 years!_
