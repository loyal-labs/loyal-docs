Loyal lets you run AI jobs the way you call a contract: send a request, pay on-chain, get a verifiable result—without new accounts or leaking data.

Below are the practical benefits and the concrete things teams are already shipping with Loyal.
## Benefits of Loyal infrastructure
- **Permissionless inference.** All you need is a Solana wallet and our SDK. No new accounts or access keys — requests, payments, and results happen natively on-chain.
- **Decentralized and reliable.** No single point of failure. Multiple providers can serve the same model; jobs are routed and retried automatically.
- **Earn as a compute provider.** Run verified nodes and get paid per request. Simple setup, transparent on-chain payouts.
- **Host verified agents.** Publish your agent or tool to the registry, set pricing, and serve users without ever seeing their data.
- **End-to-end privacy.** Requests are processed inside confidential compute; operators and developers cannot view user inputs or outputs.
- **Open source.** Core components are open and auditable to build trust and speed up integrations.

## Use Cases possible with Loyal
1. **Fully private AI assistant.** Handle legal, medical, or financial documents without exposing raw data to any third party.
2. **Smart-contract automation.** Contracts call AI oracles directly (for example: classification, extraction, scoring) and act on results on-chain.
3. **DAO and multisig operations.** Teams fund AI workloads from a multisig with spend limits and on-chain receipts for every task.
4. **Voice and SMS inbox.** Call or text an agent; speech is transcribed and processed privately end-to-end, then summarized back to you.
5. **OCR and ASR microservices.** Convert invoices, scans, and calls to structured text for downstream agents — the tool never sees user data.
6. **Tax "Klerk" helper.** Ingest wallet activity, extract taxable events, and draft reports while keeping inputs encrypted.
7. **Mini-apps (Farcaster or Telegram).** Light UIs that sign actions with your wallet; spending is capped by your chosen limit.
8. **Enterprise email, Telegram, and X triage.** Ingest off-chain messages, extract facts, and update a memory graph so agents can take informed actions.
9. **DeFi risk and pricing signals.** Models compute risk scores or price hints off-chain and return signed results to contracts.
10. **Model and agent marketplace.** Creators list models or tools, set prices, and get paid per call — users choose providers with on-chain reputation.
