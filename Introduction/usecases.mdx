        Loyal gives you private compute for the prompts you never want turning up in discovery or an ad profile. Every request runs inside attested TEEs, pays on-chain, and never touches a centralized logging stack.

        - Ask sensitive legal, medical, or personal questions without creating a subpoena-ready data trail.
        - Keep your conversation history portable: export it from our interface, load it into a self-hosted fork, or delete it outright.
        - Pay from your wallet with no credit card metadata, cookies, or retargeting pixels following you around.

        Your chats, agents, and automations live on an open stack. Because inference contracts and state are permissionless, you can treat Loyal like another protocol in your toolbox.

        - Fork our frontend repo, remix the UX, ship a CLI: we do not care and encourage you to do whatever you want with it. Everything stays compatible because the state is on-chain.
        - Plug your own smart contracts into ours to orchestrate agents, enforce spend limits, or trigger downstream actions.
        - Build multi-agent systems that handshake through wallets, instead of API keys, with verifiable execution proofs.

        High-sensitivity teams finally get AI without leaking deal flow, trade secrets, or customer data. Loyal is the privacy-preserving inference layer for finance, custody, and regulated operators.

        - Run compliance, risk, and ops workloads in confidential compute with auditable attestations for regulators or partners.
        - Let clients keep custody of their data while your service still delivers personalized insights or automation.
        - Standardize on the same infrastructure your developers useâ€”no vendor lock-in, easy to extend with your own contracts and policies.
