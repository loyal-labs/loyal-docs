## The New Surveliance Threat

Centralized AI models log every request, cross-link it with behavioral data, and monetize your very thoughts intent. We don't use LLM's like we use traditional serach engines: instead of asking things and finding exact answers we fully ofload our tohught process to LLM providers becoming more and more dependendent on them. We cannot keep sensitive workloads private when the provider owns the runtime, the memory, and the payment rails.

<Warning>
Until Loyal ships, you should treat any centralized inference service as a potential data breach waiting to happen.
