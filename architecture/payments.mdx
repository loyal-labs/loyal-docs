## Requirements You Enforce

| Constraint | Target | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finality | < 1 second | You need deterministic confirmation before releasing outputs. |
| Fee Ceiling | < $0.001 | You keep inference pricing predictable at penny scale. |
| Spending Controls | Smart-contract enforced | You prevent compromised agents from draining reserves. |
| Censorship Resistance | Global availability | You guarantee access regardless of jurisdiction. |

## Reference Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Allocate Budget">
  You lock stablecoins into a MetaDAO-supervised escrow that enforces daily spend limits per agent.
</Step>
<Step title="Stream Payments">
  Payment channels distribute micro-settlements to service agents as each inference step completes.
</Step>
<Step title="Reconcile">
  Settlement data syncs with your accounting tooling, producing auditable ledgers without revealing user identities.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Anchor your treasury in assets that match inference demand. Volatility management is a core operational control, not an afterthought.
