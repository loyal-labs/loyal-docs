## Trusted Execution Baseline

- You require hardware that supports AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, or equivalent confidential computing guarantees.
- Each enclave produces an attestation signed by the chip vendor, proving code identity and memory isolation.
- Reproducible builds ensure compiled binaries match open-source references bit-for-bit.

<Warning>
Never route private workloads to an agent that cannot present a fresh, verifiable attestation.
</Warning>

## Data Lifecycle Controls

<Steps>
<Step title="Session Initialization">
  You generate ephemeral keys inside the enclave using its hardware RNG and negotiate encrypted channels before transmitting payloads.
</Step>
<Step title="Isolated Processing">
  Inference runs entirely inside encrypted memory pages. Hypervisors, OS kernels, and co-resident workloads only observe ciphertext.
</Step>
<Step title="Secure Teardown">
  On completion, the agent performs authenticated erasure on session keys and clears memory buffers before returning results.

  <Check>
  You receive a completion receipt confirming destruction of session state.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Side-Channel Mitigations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Timing">
  Agents batch cryptographic operations and pad runtimes to reduce observable differences between requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Memory Access">
  Sensitive inference paths randomize memory access patterns, limiting correlation opportunities for adversaries monitoring buses.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Traffic Analysis">
  Multi-hop routing and payment mixing increase the cost of linking queries to specific users or capabilities.

<Info>
You should treat hardware trust as a living assumptionâ€”monitor vendor advisories and rotate hardware certificates whenever firmware updates land.
