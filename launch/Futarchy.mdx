---

Loyal exists to protect private cognition with verifiable math. We need a mechanism that keeps the community's focus on measurable privacy guarantees, service reliability, and user trust. Futarchy gives us a framework where decisions are judged by outcomes we can cryptographically audit instead of by whoever writes the longest forum post.

## What Is Futarchy

Futarchy separates values from bets. Token holders first vote on the metrics that express Loyal's mandate; for example, percentage of inference requests executed inside attested hardware, or the rate at which agents complete jobs without leaking prompts. Once the values are fixed, policy proposals compete in prediction markets. Traders stake on which proposal will maximize the chosen metric, pushing capital toward the most credible forecasts. When the market closes, Loyal executes the policy whose market price implies the highest expected score, and the traders who backed the winning prediction earn the spread.


## Why It Fits Our Vision

Markets settle on policies with data, aligning with our conviction that privacy must be enforced by cryptography, not trust. With futarchy anyone who can quantify risk can influence direction, regardless of geography or social capital, critical for a protocol defending borderless cognition.

## Why We Chose Futarchy

- It operationalizes our manifesto by letting the community define inviolable metrics and then enforcing them through market consensus.
- It scales with the protocol: the same instruments that decide a grants budget can later adjudicate validator onboarding or policy for zero-knowledge attestations.
- It keeps governance transparent and auditable. Every decision leaves a market trail, a set of signed trades, and an oracle-fed metric that can be independently verified.

Futarchy is not the absence of human judgment; it is a commitment that every major decision must compete against a measurable prediction. This is how Loyal keeps privacy-first infrastructure accountable to the community it serves.
