title: "MetaDAO"
---

MetaDAO is a futarchy launchpad that turns governance into a market, letting outcomes and incentives converge in real time. It frames every major decision as a tradable signal, so the best ideas surface through proof instead of persuasion.

We strongly believe MetaDAO is the right stack for us. It lives natively on Solana—the same layer where we settle micropayments, enforce spending limits, and stream rewards—so funding, governance, and daily usage all run on one fast, inexpensive ledger.

Stay tuned on <a href="https://metadao.fi">metadao.fi</a> for launch timing, contributor guides, and deeper updates as we get closer to mainnet activation.
