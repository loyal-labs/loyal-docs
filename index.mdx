# Problem

Your chats with LLMs have no legal protection. **Every single one of you** is exposed to these fundamental risks:
- **Government surveillance**: In the last 10 years, Meta, Microsoft and Google alone [complied](https://surfshark.com/government-requests-for-user-data) 
    with nearly 9M government queries. 35% of those were coming from the US agencies.
- **Model training**: Meta [is already using](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/meta-plans-to-sell-targeted-ads-based-on-data-in-your-ai-chats/) your chat data to target their ads.
    xAI is [planning](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/elon-musk-says-x-plans-to-introduce-ads-in-groks-responses/) to do the same. 
    OpenAI [plans](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/ads-might-be-coming-to-chatgpt-despite-sam-altman-not-being-a-fan/) the same.
- **No control**: There is no privacy guarantees when the provider owns the runtime, the memory and the payment rails. 


# Solution
We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. Here's how we're going to do:
- **Open and verifiable infra**: everything we build can be auidted by anyone.
We use Intel TDX to create signed hash of code running on machines.
If that hash matches the one from Github, it proves our oracles run the coe you saw in our repos.

- **Smart contract streaming**: we use [MagicBlock](http://magicblock.xyz/) TEE rollups to handle queries and responses.
Your data is verifiably only yours. 

- **Confidential Compute**: we run Nvidia Hopper GPUs in CC mode. 
They provide hardware signed attestation of the encryption and the model being run.
