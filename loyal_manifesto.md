## A Neocypherpunk's Manifesto
by Chris Cherniakov

The internet was designed to be free and open.

HTTP is free and open for anyone.

SMTP is free and open for anyone.

AI was free and open for anyone.

We built it on sharing information, research, science – just to see it being closed off by five marketing startups who are making tools our children will become entirely dependent on. Their decisions already drive most of our fundamental experiences online. Every day we encounter an intelligence telling us things we can and cannot do with our lives.

We have perhaps months, not years, before these dependencies become too strong to break. Soon, these five companies will have access to most working populations globally. They made their fortunes preying on us for the last decade and now they’re looking to show our very thoughts.

Do you want this future for our children? When’s enough is enough?

We must defend our own cognitive freedom if we expect to have any. We must ensure that each party to an AI interaction has access to intelligence that serves their interests directly. In most cases, centralized control is not necessary. When I query an AI for information, there is no need for a corporation to log my thoughts. When I ask an AI to help me write or reason, the provider need not know what I'm thinking or why; they only need to provide the computational service. When my intelligence is mediated by systems controlled by others, I have no cognitive autonomy. I cannot selectively reveal my mind; I must always submit to their judgment.

Neocypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Neocypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Neocypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.

The Neocypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.
